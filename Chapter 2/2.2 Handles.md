A handle points indirectly to a small data structure in kernel space that holds a few pieces of information for that handle.

On 32 bit systems, this handle entry is 8 bytes in size, and it’s 16 bytes in size on 64 bit systems (technically 12 bytes are enough, but it’s extended to 16 bytes for alignment purposes). Each entry has the following ingredients:

- Pointer to the actual object. Since the lower bits are used for flags and to improve CPU access times by address alignment, an object’s address is multiple of 8 on 32 bit systems and multiple of 16 on 64 bit systems.
- Access mask, indicating what can be done with this handle. In other words, the access mask is the power of the handle.
- Three flags: Inheritance, Protect from close and Audit on close (discussed shortly).

The access mask is a bitmask, where each “1” bit indicating a certain operation that can be carried using that handle. The access mask is set when the handle is created by creating an object or opening an existing object. If the object is created, then the caller typically has full access to the object. But if the object is opened, the caller needs to specify the required access mask, which it may or may not get.
