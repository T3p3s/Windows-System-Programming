A handle points indirectly to a small data structure in kernel space that holds a few pieces of information for that handle.

On 32 bit systems, this handle entry is 8 bytes in size, and it‚Äôs 16 bytes in size on 64 bit systems (technically 12 bytes are enough, but it‚Äôs extended to 16 bytes for alignment purposes). Each entry has the following ingredients:

- Pointer to the actual object. Since the lower bits are used for flags and to improve CPU access times by address alignment, an object‚Äôs address is multiple of 8 on 32 bit systems and multiple of 16 on 64 bit systems.
- Access mask, indicating what can be done with this handle. In other words, the access mask is the power of the handle.
- Three flags: Inheritance, Protect from close and Audit on close (discussed shortly).

The access mask is a bitmask, where each ‚Äú1‚Äù bit indicating a certain operation that can be carried using that handle. The access mask is set when the handle is created by creating an object or opening an existing object. If the object is created, then the caller typically has full access to the object. But if the object is opened, the caller needs to specify the required access mask, which it may or may not get.

### Objects: The Attractions in the Theme Park

Objects are like the attractions in the park‚Äîrides, food stands, games, and souvenir shops. Each attraction is a valuable resource that the park (Windows) manages. Just like the park has various types of attractions, Windows has different types of objects:

- **Roller coasters** ‚Üí Files (e.g., high-speed thrills for data)
- **Arcade machines** ‚Üí Processes and threads (working hard behind the scenes)
- **Ticket booths** ‚Üí Synchronization primitives like mutexes and events (keeping things orderly)
- **Hot dog stands** ‚Üí Named pipes (for sharing resources, like a delicious meal!)

Each attraction has its own:

- **Name**: Like ‚ÄúMega Coaster 3000‚Äù (or `Global\MyMutex` in Windows).
- **Rules (Permissions)**: Can kids ride? Who gets access?
- **Staff (Reference Count)**: How many guests (handles) are using the attraction? If no one is there, it closes.

### Handles: Your Magic Wristband

Now, to enjoy the theme park, you need a **magic wristband**‚Äîthis is your **handle**. When you enter the park, you don‚Äôt directly interact with the behind-the-scenes machinery of the rides or the cooks at the hot dog stand. Instead, you use your wristband to access these resources.

- When you buy a ticket for a ride, the park staff scans your wristband and lets you in. 
- If you want a soda, your wristband grants you access to the concession stand. ü•§

In Windows, a handle works the same way:

- It‚Äôs your ticket to interact with an object without messing with its inner workings.
- It ensures that you (and only you) can use resources you‚Äôve been granted access to.

### How It Works in the Park

1. **Getting Your Wristband (Creating a Handle)**: When you approach the ticket booth, the staff gives you a wristband. Similarly, when your program creates or opens an object, Windows gives you a handle.
```c
HANDLE hFile = CreateFile(L"coaster_rides.txt", GENERIC_READ, 0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
```
2. **Enjoying the Ride (Using the Handle)**: Now you‚Äôre on the ride! You can perform actions using your wristband, like speeding up, slowing down, or simply enjoying the view. In Windows, you use the handle to read from files, write data, or signal events.
```c
DWORD bytesRead;
char buffer[100];
ReadFile(hFile, buffer, sizeof(buffer), &bytesRead, NULL);
```
3. **Leaving the Park (Closing the Handle)**: When you‚Äôre done, you take off the wristband, and the ride staff marks you as ‚Äúdone.‚Äù In Windows, this means calling `CloseHandle` to release your access to the object.
```c
CloseHandle(hFile);
```
This also tells the park staff (Windows Object Manager): _‚ÄúHey, no one‚Äôs using this ride anymore; it can shut down if no one else shows up.‚Äù_

### Important Park Rules

1. **Sharing Wristbands**:  
    Some wristbands can be shared between friends (processes) if you tell the staff in advance. These are **inheritable handles**.
    
    _Example_: A parent buys one wristband and shares it with their child. In programming terms, you mark a handle as inheritable when spawning a child process.
    
2. **VIP Wristbands (Access Rights)**:  
    Not all wristbands are created equal. Some let you skip lines (read and write access), while others are just for entry (read-only). Be sure you ask for the right kind of access when you get your wristband.
    
3. **Closing Time (Reference Count)**:  
    When everyone leaves the park, the rides stop running. Similarly, if all handles to an object are closed, the object is no longer needed and is cleaned up by Windows.

### Final Thoughts: Stay in the Park, Not Behind the Scenes

Handles are there to ensure you don‚Äôt have to mess with the gears and bolts of the rides (the internal structure of kernel objects). It‚Äôs all about keeping the experience safe, efficient, and fun‚Äîwhether you're riding roller coasters or managing files in Windows!

üé† **So go ahead‚Äîgrab your handle, enjoy the object, and remember to close it when you‚Äôre done!** üé¢
