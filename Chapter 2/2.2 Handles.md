A handle points indirectly to a small data structure in kernel space that holds a few pieces of information for that handle.

On 32 bit systems, this handle entry is 8 bytes in size, and it’s 16 bytes in size on 64 bit systems (technically 12 bytes are enough, but it’s extended to 16 bytes for alignment purposes). Each entry has the following ingredients:

- Pointer to the actual object. Since the lower bits are used for flags and to improve CPU access times by address alignment, an object’s address is multiple of 8 on 32 bit systems and multiple of 16 on 64 bit systems.
- Access mask, indicating what can be done with this handle. In other words, the access mask is the power of the handle.
- Three flags: Inheritance, Protect from close and Audit on close (discussed shortly).

The access mask is a bitmask, where each “1” bit indicating a certain operation that can be carried using that handle. The access mask is set when the handle is created by creating an object or opening an existing object. If the object is created, then the caller typically has full access to the object. But if the object is opened, the caller needs to specify the required access mask, which it may or may not get.

### Objects: The Attractions in the Theme Park

Objects are like the attractions in the park—rides, food stands, games, and souvenir shops. Each attraction is a valuable resource that the park (Windows) manages. Just like the park has various types of attractions, Windows has different types of objects:

- **Roller coasters** → Files (e.g., high-speed thrills for data)
- **Arcade machines** → Processes and threads (working hard behind the scenes)
- **Ticket booths** → Synchronization primitives like mutexes and events (keeping things orderly)
- **Hot dog stands** → Named pipes (for sharing resources, like a delicious meal!)

Each attraction has its own:

- **Name**: Like “Mega Coaster 3000” (or `Global\MyMutex` in Windows).
- **Rules (Permissions)**: Can kids ride? Who gets access?
- **Staff (Reference Count)**: How many guests (handles) are using the attraction? If no one is there, it closes.

### Handles: Your Magic Wristband

Now, to enjoy the theme park, you need a **magic wristband**—this is your **handle**. When you enter the park, you don’t directly interact with the behind-the-scenes machinery of the rides or the cooks at the hot dog stand. Instead, you use your wristband to access these resources.

- When you buy a ticket for a ride, the park staff scans your wristband and lets you in. 🛝
- If you want a soda, your wristband grants you access to the concession stand. 🥤

In Windows, a handle works the same way:

- It’s your ticket to interact with an object without messing with its inner workings.
- It ensures that you (and only you) can use resources you’ve been granted access to.
