Some handles have special values and are not closable. These are known as pseudo-handles, although they are used just like any other handle when needed. Calling CloseHandle on pseudo-handles always fails. Here are the functions returning pseudo-handles:

- GetCurrentProcess (-1) - return a pseudo-handle to the calling process
	
- GetCurrentThread (-2) - return a pseudo-handle to the calling thread
	
- GetCurrentProcessToken (-4) - return a pseudo-handle to the token of the calling process
	
- GetCurrentThreadToken (-5) - return a pseudo-handle to the token of the calling thread
	
- GetCurrentThreadEffectiveToken (-6) - return a pseudo-handle to the effective token of the calling thread (if the thread has its own token - itâ€™s used, otherwise - its process token is used)

The last three pseudo handles (token handles) are only supported on Windows 8 and later, and their access mask is TOKEN_QUERY and TOKEN_QUERY_SOURCE only.
