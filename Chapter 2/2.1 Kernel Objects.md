The Windows kernel exposes various types of objects for use by user mode processes, the kernel itself and kernel mode drivers. Instances of these types are data structures in system (kernel) space, created and managed by the Object Manager (part of the Executive) when requested to do so by user or kernel mode code. kernel objects are reference counted, so only when the last reference to the object is released will the object be destroyed and freed from memory.

The main objects of kernel:

Kernel objects cannot be accessed directly from user mode. Applications must use an indirect mechanism to access kernel objects, known as handles.

Handles provide benefits like:
- Any change in the object typeâ€™s data structure in a future Windows release will not affect any client.
- Access to the object can be controlled through security access checks.
- Handles are private to a process, so having a handle to a particular object in one process means nothing in another process context.

Kernel objects are reference counted. The Object Manager maintains a handle count and a pointer count, the sum of which is the total reference count for an object (direct pointers can be obtained from kernel mode).
