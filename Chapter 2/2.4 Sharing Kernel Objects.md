As we’ve seen, handles to kernel objects are private to a process. In some cases, a process may want to share a kernel object with another process. Such a process cannot simply pass somehow the value of the handle to the other process, because in the other process’ handle table that handle value may point to a different object or be empty.

Clearly, some mechanism must be in place to allow such sharing. In fact, there are three:

- Sharing by name

- Sharing by handle inheritance

- Sharing by duplicating handles
