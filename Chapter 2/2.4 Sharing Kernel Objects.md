As we’ve seen, handles to kernel objects are private to a process. In some cases, a process may want to share a kernel object with another process. Such a process cannot simply pass somehow the value of the handle to the other process, because in the other process’ handle table that handle value may point to a different object or be empty.

Clearly, some mechanism must be in place to allow such sharing. In fact, there are three:

- Sharing by name

- Sharing by handle inheritance

- Sharing by duplicating handles

#### Sharing by name

This is the simplest option, if available. “Available” here means that the object in question can have a name, and does have a name. The typical scenario is that the cooperating processes (2 or more) would call the appropriate Create function with the same object name. The first process to make the call would create the object, and subsequent calls from the other processes would open additional handles to the same object.

#### Sharing by Handle Duplication

Sharing kernel objects by name is certainly simple. What about objects that don’t (or can’t have a name)? Handle duplication may be the answer. Handle duplication has no inherent restrictions (except security) - it can work on almost any kernel object, named or unnamed and it works at any point in time.

How to Duplicate? Using `DuplicateHandle`
```c
BOOL DuplicateHandle(

_In_ HANDLE hSourceProcessHandle, 
_In_ HANDLE hSourceHandle, 
_In_ HANDLE hTargetProcessHandle, 
_Outptr_ LPHANDLE lpTargetHandle, 
_In_ DWORD dwDesiredAccess, 
_In_ BOOL bInheritHandle,
_In_ DWORD dwOptions);
```

Duplicating a handle requires a source process, source handle and a target process. If successful, a new handle entry is written to the target process handle table, pointing to the same object as the source handle.

`DuplicateHandle` in details:
- hSourceProcessHandle - this is a handle to the source process. This handle must have the PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE access mask. If the source is the caller’s process then passing GetCurrentProcess will do the trick (and it always has full access).
	
- hSourceHandle - the source handle to duplicate. This handle must be valid in the context of the source process.
	
- hTargetProcessHandle - the target process handle. Typically some call to OpenProcess must be used to gain such a handle. As with the source process, the PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE access mask is required.
	
- lpTargetHandle - this is the resulting handle, valid from the target process perspective. In figure 2-18, the resulting handle returned to the caller was 72. This value is with respect to Process B (the caller is assumed to be process A).
	
- dwDesiredAccess - the desired access mask for the duplicated handle. If the dwOptions parameter has the flag DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS, then this access mask is ignored. Otherwise, this is the access mask to request for the new handle.
	
- bInheritHandle - specifies whether the new handle is inheritable or not (see chapter 3 for more on handle inheritance).
	
- dwOptions - a set of flags. One is DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS discussed above. The second supported is DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE; if specified, closes the source handle after a successful duplication (this means the handle count for the object is not incremented).

Here's an example of it:
```c
HANDLE hJob = ::CreateJobObject(nullptr, nullptr); 
HANDLE hJob2; ::DuplicateHandle(::GetCurrentProcess(), hJob, ::GetCurrentProcess(), &hJob2, JOB_OBJECT_ASSIGN_PROCESS | JOB_OBJECT_TERMINATE, FALSE, 0);
```

One handle (0xac) has full access to the job object, while the other (duplicated) handle (0xb0) has just the specified desired access mask.

In the more common case, a handle from the current process is duplicated to a target cooperating process.
