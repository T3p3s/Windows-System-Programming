As we’ve seen, handles to kernel objects are private to a process. In some cases, a process may want to share a kernel object with another process. Such a process cannot simply pass somehow the value of the handle to the other process, because in the other process’ handle table that handle value may point to a different object or be empty.

Clearly, some mechanism must be in place to allow such sharing. In fact, there are three:

- Sharing by name

- Sharing by handle inheritance

- Sharing by duplicating handles

#### Sharing by name

This is the simplest option, if available. “Available” here means that the object in question can have a name, and does have a name. The typical scenario is that the cooperating processes (2 or more) would call the appropriate Create function with the same object name. The first process to make the call would create the object, and subsequent calls from the other processes would open additional handles to the same object.
