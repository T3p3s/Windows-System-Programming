Think of virtual memory as a way for your computer to manage memory more flexibly. It allows programs to think they have more memory available than what's physically in the computer (RAM).

The address space range starts at zero (although technically the first 64KB of address cannot be allocated), and goes all the way to a maximum which depends on the process “bitness” (32 or 64 bit), the operating system “bitness” and a linker flag, as follows: 
- For 32-bit processes on 32-bit Windows systems, the process address space size is 2 GB by default.  
- For 32-bit processes on 32-bit Windows systems that use the increase user address space setting, that process address space size can be as large as 3 GB (depending on the exact setting). To get the extended address space range, the executable from which the process was created must have been marked with the LARGEADDRESSAWARE linker flag in its header. If it was not, it would still be limited to 2 GB. 
- For 64-bit processes (on a 64-bit Windows system, naturally), the address space size is 8 TB (Windows 8 and earlier) or 128 TB (Windows 8.1 and later).
- For 32-bit processes on a 64-bit Windows system, the address space size is 4 GB if the executable image is linked with the LARGEADDRESSAWARE flag. Otherwise, the size remains at 2 GB.
