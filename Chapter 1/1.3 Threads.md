Thread us contained within a process, using the resources exposed by the process to do work (for instance virtual memory and handles to kernel objects). Thread owns:
- Current access mode, either user or kernel.
- Execution context, including processor registers.
- A stack, used for local variable allocations and call management. 
- Thread Local Storage (TLS) array, which provides a way to store thread-private data with uniform access semantics. 
- Base priority and a current (dynamic) priority. 
- Processor affinity, indicating on which processors the thread is allowed to run on.
