Process is a management of the running program. Threads are the ones that technically execute the code.

A process owns the following: 
- An executable program, which contains the initial code and data used to execute code within the process. 
- A private virtual address space, used for allocating memory for whatever purposes the code within the process needs it. 
- An access token (sometimes referred to as primary token), which is an object that stores the default security context of the process, used by threads executing code within the process (unless a thread assumes a different token by using impersonation).  
- A private handle table to Executive (kernel) objects, such as events, semaphores, and files. 
- One or more threads of execution. A normal user-mode process is created with one thread (executing the main entry point for the process). A user-mode process without threads is mostly useless and under normal circumstances will be destroyed by the kernel.
