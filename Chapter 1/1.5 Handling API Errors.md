The most common case is returning a BOOL type. The BOOL type is not the same as the C++ bool type; BOOL is in fact a 32-bit signed integer.

Here is an example of handling such an error:
```c
BOOL success = ::CallSomeAPIThatReturnsBOOL();
if(!success)
{
	// error - handle it (in this example just prints)
	printf("Error: %d\n", ::GetLastError());
}
```
