Process creation starts with kernel opening the image(executable) file and verification of it's proper format known as Portable Executable (PE). The file extension doesn't matter, only the actually content does.  After verification of the headers, the kernel creates new process kernel object and a thread kernel object, because a normal process is created with one thread that eventually should execute the main entry point.
