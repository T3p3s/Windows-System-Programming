#### Process types

- **Protected Processes** - These processes were introduced in Windows Vista. They were created to support Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection by preventing intrusive access to processes rendering DRM-protected content. For example, no other process (even running with administrator rights) can read the memory within a protected process address space, so the DRM-protected data cannot be directly stolen.
- **UWP Processes** - These processes, available starting with Windows 8, host the Windows Runtime, and typically are published to the Microsoft Store. A UWP process executes inside an AppContainer - a sandbox of sorts that limits the operations this process can carry out.
- **Protected Processes Light (PPL)** - These processes (available from Windows 8.1) extended the protection mechanism from Vista by adding several levels of protection and even allowing third-party services to run as PPL, protecting them from intrusive access, and from termination, even by admin-level processes.
- **Minimal Processes** - These processes available from Windows 10 version 1607, is a truly new form of process. The address space of a minimal process does not contain the usual images and data structures that a normal process does. For example, there is no executable file mapped into the process address space, and no DLLs. The process address space is truly empty.
- **Pico Processes** - These processes are minimal processes with one addition: a Pico provider, which is a kernel driver that intercepts Linux system calls and translates them to equivalent Windows system calls. These processes are used with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), available from Windows 10 version 1607.
