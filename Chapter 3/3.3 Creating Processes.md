`CreateProcess` function needs an actual executable name. For instance if you would pass something like `C:\MyData\data.txt` assuming `data.txt` is some text file - will fail process creation. `CreateProcess` accepts only `EXE` files, even if `.exe` wasn't specified at the end, it will search the registry based on the file extension to locate the associated program to execute.  

It's a BOOL function, return TRUE on success.
```c
BOOL CreateProcess(

_In_opt_ PCTSTR pApplicationName, 
_Inout_opt_ PTSTR pCommandLine,
_In_opt_ PSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES pProcessAttributes, 
_In_opt_ PSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES pThreadAttributes,
_In_ BOOL bInheritHandles, 
_In_ DWORD dwCreationFlags, 
_In_opt_ PVOID pEnvironment,
_In_opt_ PCTSTR pCurrentDirectory, 
_In_ PSTARTUPINFO pStartupInfo, 
_Out_ PPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation);
```

If successful, the real information is available via the last argument of type `PROCESS_INFORMATION`

```c
typedef struct _PROCESS_INFORMATION { 
HANDLE hProcess; 
HANDLE hThread; 
DWORD dwProcessId; 
DWORD dwThreadId; 
} PROCESS_INFORMATION, *PPROCESS_INFORMATION;
```

`pStartupinfo` uses `STARTUPINFO` structure. Zeroing the structure is important, otherwise it holds junk values which will likely cause `CreateProcess` to fail. Example:

```c
STARTUPINFO si = {sizeof(si)};
CreateProcess(..., &si, ...);
```

Example of creating process:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>


int main() {

	WCHAR name[] = L"notepad.exe";
	STARTUPINFO si = { sizeof(si) };
	PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;

	BOOL CreatingProcess = CreateProcess(NULL, name, NULL, NULL, FALSE, 0, NULL, NULL, &si, &pi);

	if (!CreatingProcess) {
		printf("[-] Wasn't able to create the process: %d \n", GetLastError());
		return -1;
	}
	printf("[+] Process created. PID = %d \n", pi.dwProcessId);

	//WaitForSingleObject(pi.hProcess, INFINITE); 
	//printf("Notepad terminated. \n");

	DWORD rv = ::WaitForSingleObject(pi.hProcess, 10000); 
	if (rv == WAIT_TIMEOUT)
		printf("Notepad still running...\n");
	else if (rv == WAIT_OBJECT_0)
		printf("Notepad terminated.\n");
	else // WAIT_ERROR (unlikely in this case)
		printf("Error! %d\n", ::GetLastError());

	CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
	CloseHandle(pi.hThread);
	

	return 0;
}
```

`WaitForSingleObject` puts the calling thread into a wait state until the object in question changes to the signaled state or the timeout expires. In case of `INFINITE (-1)`, it never expires.

#### Handle Inheritance

In [2.4 Sharing Kernel Objects](../Chapter%202/2.4%20Sharing%20Kernel%20Objects.md) 2 ways of sharing were presented, one is sharing by name, the other by duplicating handles. The third option is handle inheritance. This options is only available if a process creates a child process. At the point of creation, the parent process can duplicate a selected set of handles to the target process. Once `CreateProcess` is called with the fifth argument set to TRUE, all handles in parent process that have their inheritance bit set will be duplicated into the child process, where the handle values are the same as in the parent process.

Setting a handle to be inheritable can be done in several ways:

- If the object in question is created by the parent process, then its SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES can be initialized with a handle inheritance flag and passed to the Create function like so:

```c
SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES sa = { sizeof(sa) }; sa.bInheritHandles = TRUE; HANDLE h = ::CreateEvent(&sa, FALSE, FALSE, nullptr);

// handle h will be inherited by child processes
```

- For an existing handle, call `SetHandleInformation`:

```c
::SetHandleInformation(h, HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT , HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT);
```

- Lastly, most Open functions allow setting the inheritance flag on a successfully returned handle. Here is an example for a named event object:

```c
HANDLE h = ::OpenEvent(EVENT_ALL_ACCESS,

TRUE, // inheritable

L"MyEvent");
```

**Debugging Child Processes with Visual Studio**

In the InheritSharing application, it’s desirable to debug not just the main instance, but also a child process, because it’s initiated with a different command line. Visual Studio by default does not debug child processes (processes created by the debugged process).

There is, however, an extension to Visual Studio that allows this. Open the extensions dialog (Tools/Extensions and Updates in VS 2017, Extensions/Manage Extensions in VS 2019), go to the Online node and search for Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool and install it

![](../Media/Pasted%20image%2020250320124512.png)

Once installed, go to Debug/Other Debug Targets/Child Process Debugger Settings…, check Enable Child Process Debugging and click Save. Now set a breakpoint at `CMainDlg::OnInitDialog` and start debugging normally (F5).

The first time you hit the breakpoint is when the dialog comes up for a fresh process, creating its own shared memory object. The count variable should be 1

![](../Media/Pasted%20image%2020250320124536.png)

Continue debugging and click Create. A new process should come up under the control of the debugger and the same breakpoint should hit again (figure 3-16). Notice count is now 2. Also notice it’s a different process - the Processes toolbar combobox should show two processes

#### Process and Thread Attributes

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

DWORD CreateProcessWithParent(PWSTR name, DWORD dwparentPid) {

    HANDLE hParent = OpenProcess(PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS | PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE, FALSE, dwparentPid);
    if (!hParent) {
        wprintf(L"Failed to open parent process. Error: %lu\n", GetLastError());
        return 0;
    }

    PROCESS_INFORMATION pi = { 0 };
    PPROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_LIST attList = NULL;

    do {
        SIZE_T size = 0;
        InitializeProcThreadAttributeList(NULL, 1, 0, &size);
        if (size == 0) break;

        attList = (PPROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_LIST)malloc(size);
        if (!attList) break;

        if (!InitializeProcThreadAttributeList(attList, 1, 0, &size)) break;

        if (!UpdateProcThreadAttribute(attList, 0, PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS, &hParent, sizeof(hParent), NULL, NULL))
            break;

        STARTUPINFOEX si = { sizeof(si) };
        si.lpAttributeList = attList;

        WCHAR commandLine[] = L"notepad.exe";  // Mutable buffer required
        if (!CreateProcess(NULL, commandLine, NULL, NULL, FALSE, EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT, NULL, NULL, (STARTUPINFO*)&si, &pi)) {
            wprintf(L"CreateProcess failed. Error: %lu\n", GetLastError());
            break;
        }

        wprintf(L"Successfully created process with PID: %lu\n", pi.dwProcessId);

        CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
        CloseHandle(pi.hThread);
    } while (false);

    CloseHandle(hParent);

    if (attList) {
        DeleteProcThreadAttributeList(attList);
        free(attList);
    }
    return pi.dwProcessId;
}

int main() {

    WCHAR name[] = L"notepad.exe";

    DWORD dwparentPid = 7696;  

    DWORD newPid = CreateProcessWithParent(name, dwparentPid);
    if (newPid == 0) {
        wprintf(L"Failed to create process. Error: %lu\n", GetLastError());
    }

    return 0;
}

```
