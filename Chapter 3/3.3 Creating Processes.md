`CreateProcess` function needs an actual executable name. For instance if you would pass something like `C:\MyData\data.txt` assuming `data.txt` is some text file - will fail process creation. `CreateProcess` accepts only `EXE` files, even if `.exe` wasn't specified at the end, it will search the registry based on the file extension to locate the associated program to execute.  

It's a BOOL function, return TRUE on success.
```c
BOOL CreateProcess(

_In_opt_ PCTSTR pApplicationName, 
_Inout_opt_ PTSTR pCommandLine,
_In_opt_ PSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES pProcessAttributes, 
_In_opt_ PSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES pThreadAttributes,
_In_ BOOL bInheritHandles, 
_In_ DWORD dwCreationFlags, 
_In_opt_ PVOID pEnvironment,
_In_opt_ PCTSTR pCurrentDirectory, 
_In_ PSTARTUPINFO pStartupInfo, 
_Out_ PPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation);
```

If successful, the real information is available via the last argument of type `PROCESS_INFORMATION`

```c
typedef struct _PROCESS_INFORMATION { 
HANDLE hProcess; 
HANDLE hThread; 
DWORD dwProcessId; 
DWORD dwThreadId; 
} PROCESS_INFORMATION, *PPROCESS_INFORMATION;
```

`pStartupinfo` uses `STARTUPINFO` structure. Zeroing the structure is important, otherwise it holds junk values which will likely cause `CreateProcess` to fail. Example:

```c
STARTUPINFO si = {sizeof(si)};
CreateProcess(..., &si, ...);
```
