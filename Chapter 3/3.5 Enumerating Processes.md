## Toolhelp Functions

To gain access to these functions, include <tlhelp32.h>. The initial function to call is CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, which creates a snapshot consisting of an optional combination of processes and threads, and for a specific process - heaps and modules as well. Here is the call to create the snapshot to get information for processes only:

```c
HANDLE hSnapshot = ::CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);

if (hSnapshot == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
	printf("[!] CreateToolhelp32Snapshot failed with error: %d", GetLastError());
}
```

The second parameter to CreateToolhelp32Snapshot indicates which process is the target of the snapshot in case modules or heaps are requested. For processes and threads this must be zero and all processes/threads are included in the snapshot.

Now process enumeration starts with Process32First, and subsequent processes are available by calling Process32Next until the latter returns FALSE meaning there are no more processes. Both functions accept a PROCESSENTRY32 structure pointer where the information is returned for each process:

```c
typedef struct tagPROCESSENTRY32 {
	DWORD dwSize; // size of structure
	DWORD cntUsage; // unused
	DWORD th32ProcessID; // PID
	ULONG_PTR th32DefaultHeapID; // unused
	DWORD th32ModuleID; // unused
	DWORD cntThreads; // # threads
	DWORD th32ParentProcessID; // parent PID
	LONG pcPriClassBase; // Base priority
	DWORD dwFlags; // unused
	TCHAR szExeFile[MAX_PATH]; // Path
} PROCESSENTRY32;
```
